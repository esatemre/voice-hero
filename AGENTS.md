## UI/UX Design Principles

### Responsive Layout Design
- Don't force tiny sizes to eliminate scrolling; use proper responsive design with flexbox that adapts naturally to screen size.
- Don't use fixed viewport heights without accounting for parent layouts (headers, padding, margins).
- Use generous spacing on large screens for professional appearance rather than cramming everything into minimal space.
- Allow natural scrolling behavior when needed instead of forcing hard constraints that break UX.
- Always check the browser yourself to understand the actual layout issue before making assumptions.
